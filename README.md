# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch

This repo contains code that applies machine learning techniques from scratch. There are many high-level libraries out there that hide the logic and equations from users. Implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch will help you understand them better. Most of the code is written in `Python` or `MATLAB`. Feel free to borrow the code.

Currently in this repo:
* MATLAB
  * [MLPNN (Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network)](https://github.com/yanfengliu/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/MLPNN.m)
