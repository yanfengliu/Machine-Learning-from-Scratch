# Machine-Learning-from-Scratch

This repo contains code that applies machine learning techniques from statch, meaning that I will not use high-level libraries to implement these methods. Most of them are written in Python or MATLAB. Feel free to borrow the code.

Currently in this repo:
* MATLAB
  * [Fully Connected Neural Network](https://github.com/yanfengliu/Machine-Learning-from-Scratch/blob/master/fully_connected_NN.m)
